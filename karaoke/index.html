        <p>Escape (The Piña Colada Song) Songtext</p>
        <p>I was tired of my lady</p>
        <p>We′d been together too long</p>
        <p>Like a worn out recording</p>
        <p>Of a favorite song</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>So while she lay there sleepin'</p>
        <p>I read the paper in bed</p>
        <p>And in the personal columns</p>
        <p>There was this letter I read</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>If you like piña coladas</p>
        <p>And gettin′ caught in the rain</p>
        <p>If you're not into yoga</p>
        <p>If you have half a brain</p>
        <p>If you like makin' love at midnight</p>
        <p>In the dunes on the cape</p>
        <p>Then I′m the love that you′ve looked for</p>
        <p>Write to me and escape</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>I didn't think about my lady</p>
        <p>I know that sounds kinda mean</p>
        <p>But me and my old lady</p>
        <p>Had fallen into the same old dull routine</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>So I wrote to the paper</p>
        <p>Took out a personal ad</p>
        <p>And though I′m nobody's poet</p>
        <p>I thought it wasn′t half bad</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>Yes, I like piña coladas</p>
        <p>And gettin' caught in the rain</p>
        <p>I′m not much into health food</p>
        <p>I am into champagne</p>
        <p>I've got to meet you by tomorrow noon</p>
        <p>And cut through all this red tape</p>
        <p>At a bar called O'Malley′s</p>
        <p>Where we′ll plan our escape</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>So I waited with high hopes</p>
        <p>And she walked in the place</p>
        <p>I knew her smile in an instant</p>
        <p>I knew the curve of her face</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>It was my own lovely lady</p>
        <p>And she said, "Oh, it's you"</p>
        <p>Then we laughed for a moment</p>
        <p>And I said, "I never knew"</p>
      </div>

      <div class="verse">
        <p>"That you like piña coladas</p>
        <p>And gettin′ caught in the rain</p>
        <p>And the feel of the ocean</p>
        <p>And the taste of champagne</p>
        <p>If you like making love at midnight</p>
        <p>In the dunes on the cape</p>
        <p>You're the lady I′ve looked for</p>
        <p>Come with me and escape"</p>
